Open source tool to facilitate processing information encoded in papers.

The main idea is to be able to extract in a semiautomatic way text sections, images, tables and text descriptions of images and tables as separate data objects. Under a layout aware paradigm based on [lapdftext](https://code.google.com/p/lapdftext/). We will consider only non encrypted PDFs for the extraction.
