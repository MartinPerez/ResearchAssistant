# Roadmap

- [ ] Define a extraction database content from a Zotero selection by a bib file import
- [ ] Link the extraction database with a local Zotero database. 
(would allow to save and check the extractions alongside other materials in the paper folder of Zotero)
- [ ] Define standard data structure to store and share extractions
- [ ] Feature: Work on papers store in Zotero through bib files (easy to export and update automatically with Zotero plugins) and a given Zotero database address (supposed to include the papers from the bib in some collection). Watch out for the concept of collection in Zotero that allows for a paper to be included in multiple collections and even subcollections, maybe linking with an extra indication of the collection set of the paper defined by the bib reference would solve any possible issues, but extracting this is not included in a bib file. 
- [ ] Feature: Extract text separated by titles in the processed paper
- [ ] Feature: Extract hierarchy of titles when extracting text
- [ ] Implement interface for semiautomated layout extraction.
- [ ] Implement visualization interface to check extraction alongside location in original document.
- [ ] Feature: Extract Images and Tables as Images.
- [ ] Feature: Extract actual values from tables. Transform extracted tables into csv files.
